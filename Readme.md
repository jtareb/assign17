## Yo, I'm a Readme

You should probably update me so people looking at your code have an idea what it is being used for :)
var data = { nameinfo: [
      {username: "john", firstName: "John", lastName: "Albritton", email: "jtareb1@gmail.com" },
      {username: "ed", firstName: "Ed", lastName: "Smith", email: "edsmith2@gmail.com"},
    ]};
